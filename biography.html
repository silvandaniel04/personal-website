            <h2>I grew up in...</h2>
            <p>Bucharest, capital city of Romania, an absolutely beautiful city that has the best nightlife in Eastern Europe. When I was 16, our family moved out of Bucharest in a small town called Berceni, close to the city's southern edge.</p>

            <h2>About my education and overall school experience</h2>
            <p>I completed the kindergarten, primary, and middle school cycles at the "Anastasia Popescu" Pedagogical High School, where I discovered my passion for mathematics and physics, as well as for foreign languages. Later, I decided to focus on the mathematics and computer science track and was admitted to the "Sf√¢ntul Sava" National College in 2019.

                Although, due to the pandemic, I missed a significant part of high school, my passion for mathematics and physics remained undiminished. Soon, I reached the 12th grade and was faced with the important decision of choosing a university, which, for me, was relatively simple. I knew my passions very well and understood that the Faculty of Automation and Computer Science was the best fit for me. Here, I discovered the opportunities offered by this field and grew fond of the university, both because of the atmosphere and my colleagues.
                
                I am confident that I will successfully graduate from this university and I am eager to apply what I have learned and will continue to learn.</p>
